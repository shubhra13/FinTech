Robo advisor

Generally, people consult financial planners and advisors for different investments and major financial decisions. However, financial advisors may offer biased or inaccurate advice and charge expensive consultation fees. Additionally, in today’s time and age, we prefer handling multiple tasks online. Hence, using robo-advisors for financial needs is also quite natural. Another group that can benefit from the advent of robo-advisors in fintech is the retirees from the generation of baby boomers. Compared to financial advisors, robo-advisors are inexpensive and more accurate in allocating assets, estate planning, and overall financial advice.

Robo-advisors help private investors in wealth management with the help of predefined algorithms and trends in the financial market. The utilization of robo-advisors in fintech is not a new phenomenon. Wealth managers have been using robo-advisors behind-the-scenes to gain additional information before offering their final recommendation to clients. As robo-advisors became more advanced, wealth managers were able to focus more on building client relationships and save time spent on data entry and investment management. Robo-advisors can be of three types:
Full-service robo-advisor: A full-service robo-advisor can help in all aspects of various investments. It can suggest an investment strategy, take over asset management, and rebalance investment structures.
Half-service robo-advisor: A half-service robo-advisor can only suggest investment products to help in the development of investment strategies.
Self-service robo-advisor: A self-service robo-advisor only offers tips for financial investment to private investors.
